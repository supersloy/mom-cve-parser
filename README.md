Python CVE metrics parser for thesis

## Description

mom-cve-parser is a Python project designed to parse and analyze Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) metrics for a thesis.

## Installation

To install and run this Python project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/supersloy/mom-cve-parser.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd mom-cve-parser`
3. Install the required Python dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
5. Run the parser using the command: `python main.py`

## Usage

Run the parser script to extract and process the CVE metrics. 

If you want to run only one module, you can do that using `python MODULE_FILE.py` command. In that case it will provide more details, like status of downloading pages and their links.

If parser could not find the product ID in CVEDetails site, you can add it yourself by editing `exceptions.txt` file. Format of the `exceptions.txt` is `MOM_SHORTNAME CVE_DETAILS_PRODUCT_ID` where `MOM_SHORTNAME` should be a substring of provided moms.
